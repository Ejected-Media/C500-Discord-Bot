The "Seller Agreement" (or in your case, the "Certified Builder Agreement") is the glue holding this federated model together. It transforms a "handshake deal" into a professional operation without feeling like corporate handcuffs.
Since you are dealing with independent creators, this agreement needs to be a "Hybrid Contract": Part Vendor Agreement (shipping/money) and part Creator Code of Conduct (behavior/streaming).
Here is the draft structure for the agreement that every Builder must sign (digitally via the Bot/Stripe Onboarding) before they can list their first item.
C500 CERTIFIED BUILDER AGREEMENT
"The Handshake Protocol"
1. The Relationship (Who is who?)
 * C500 ("The Platform"): We are the venue, the escrow agent, and the technology provider. We do not own the inventory.
 * The Builder ("You"): You are the Seller of Record. You own the stock, you set the price, and you are legally responsible for the product quality.
 * The Service: C500 provides you with the Bot, the Payment Gateway, and the Reputation System in exchange for a Platform Fee (10%).
2. The "Proof of Work" (The Twitch Clause)
This is the unique clause that defines your business model.
> "To unlock the release of funds held in escrow, the Builder agrees to one of the following verification methods:
>  * Method A (The Live Build): Stream the assembly of the Sold Unit on a linked Twitch account for a minimum of 30 minutes, verbally acknowledging the Order ID.
>  * Method B (The VOD): Upload a time-stamped video of the build or a specific 'Sound Test' verification video to the Order Ticket.
>  * Failure to Verify: If valid proof is not provided within 7 days of the promised build date, C500 reserves the right to refund the Buyer in full from the escrow balance."
> 
3. Shipping & Fulfillment Standards (The SLA)
Strict timelines prevent 'exit scams'.
 * The "7-Day Rule": Once a build is marked "Complete," tracking information must be uploaded to the C500 Bot within 7 calendar days.
 * Packaging Standard: All items must be packed in double-walled boxes or with sufficient bubble wrap to survive a 3-foot drop (The "Thock Protection" standard).
 * Insurance: The Builder is responsible for insuring the package. If it arrives broken, the Builder absorbs the loss, not the Buyer or C500.
4. The "Code of Conduct" (Community Safety)
Since they represent your brand, they can't be toxic.
> "As a Certified Builder, you are an ambassador of the C500 network. We reserve the right to revoke your status and ban your Stripe account for:
>  * Toxic Behavior: Hate speech, harassment, or doxxing in any Discord server (not just yours).
>  * Scalping: Using the C500 Bot to flip products at >200% MSRP without adding value (e.g., selling raw switches at 3x price).
>  * Shilling: Creating fake buyer accounts to artificially inflate your Reputation Score."
> 
5. Financial Terms (The Money)
 * Commission: C500 deducts a flat 10% fee from the Gross Transaction Value (including shipping) at the source.
 * Tax Liability: You acknowledge that as the Seller of Record, you are responsible for any Income Tax or VAT obligations in your local jurisdiction. C500 will provide a 1099-K form via Stripe if you cross the IRS reporting threshold.
 * Chargeback Liability: If a buyer wins a dispute due to your failure to ship or verifying quality, the funds will be clawed back from your future earnings or linked bank account.
6. The "Kill Switch" (Termination)
> "C500 operates a Zero Tolerance Fraud Policy. If you are found to have intentionally defrauded a user (e.g., 'rocks in a box'), we will:
>  * Immediately freeze your Stripe Payouts.
>  * Global Ban your User ID and Hardware ID from the C500 Network.
>  * Release all your personal verification data (Name, Address) to the relevant authorities and the defrauded buyer for legal action."
> 
Next Steps to Launch
We have now designed the entire C500 Ecosystem:
 * Business Model: Federated Marketplace (Discord + Twitch + Stripe).
 * User Experience: Bot-driven drops and live-stream verification.
 * Trust System: Tiered Buyer Passports and Builder Reputation.
 * Legal/Safety: The Builder Agreement and Anti-Fraud Protocol.

Would you like me to synthesize this entire session into a "C500 Pitch Deck" outline? This would be a 10-slide summary you can use to pitch this concept to your first 5 "Founding Builders" to get them on board.
