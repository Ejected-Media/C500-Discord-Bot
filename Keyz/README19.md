Here is a visual walkthrough of the C500 Marketplace from the perspective of both the Builder and the Buyer, showcasing the "cozy pastel" aesthetic in action.

#### Step 1: 
##### The Builder Creates a Drop
The builder, Keyz, uses a private staff channel to list a new keyboard. The bot provides a simple, modal interface to input all the details, ensuring every listing is consistent and complete.

#### Step 2: 
##### The Buyer Sees the Shop
Once the drop is created, it appears in the public #marketplace channel as a beautiful, pastel-themed embed. This is what the buyer, Alex, sees. The "Buy Now" button is prominent and inviting.

#### Step 3: 
##### The Buyer Completes the Purchase
Clicking the "Buy Now" button triggers a private Direct Message from the C500 bot. This DM contains a secure, ephemeral link to Stripe for payment. Once the payment is complete, the bot confirms the order instantly.

#### Step 4: 
##### The Builder Gets the Order
Finally, the C500 bot notifies the builder in their private #orders channel. The notification includes all the necessary details and a button to mark the order as shipped once fulfillment is complete.
