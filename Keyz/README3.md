This request is exciting—it sounds like C500 (Classroom 500) is evolving into a community-driven marketplace for mechanical keyboard enthusiasts.
Since I don't have access to your specific past conversation logs due to privacy design, I cannot "replay" our previous chats. However, I can reconstruct a strategic Business Model Review for C500 based on the specific pillars you mentioned: selling mechanical keyboards via Discord, Instagram, and Twitch.
Here is a review of how that business model functions for this specific niche.
C500 Marketplace: Strategic Review
Core Value Proposition: A community-first marketplace for mechanical keyboard enthusiasts that leverages live engagement (Twitch) and visual hype (Instagram) to drive exclusive sales and community retention (Discord).
1. The "Community Funnel" Strategy
The mechanical keyboard niche relies heavily on "Group Buys" and limited drops. Your model uses a distinct funnel for this:
 * Top of Funnel (Awareness & Hype): Instagram
   * Role: The visual storefront.
   * Strategy: High-fidelity typing videos (ASMR), "keeb" aesthetics, and colorway reveals.
   * Key Mechanic: Uses Instagram Stories/Reels to countdown to "Drops" that happen elsewhere.
 * Middle of Funnel (Trust & Validation): Twitch
   * Role: The interactive showroom.
   * Strategy: Live build streams. Viewers can see the C500 keyboards being built, lubed, and typed on in real-time. This eliminates the "online buying risk" by validating quality live.
   * Key Mechanic: "Build my Board" streams where customers watch their specific order being assembled.
 * Bottom of Funnel (Retention & Sales): Discord
   * Role: The exclusive club.
   * Strategy: This is where the actual "Marketplace" lives.
   * Key Mechanic:
     * Early Access: Discord members get link drops 1 hour before the public.
     * Feedback Loop: Members vote on the next keycap colors or switch types (making them feel like "investors" in the product).
2. Revenue Streams & Sales Mechanics
 * The "Group Buy" Model: Instead of holding massive inventory, C500 likely operates on pre-orders funded by the community. You collect cash upfront via a "Group Buy" window, then manufacture.
 * Commission/Service Fees: If C500 is a marketplace for other builders, you likely take a transaction fee (e.g., 5-10%) for vetting the seller and hosting the community.
 * Twitch Subscriptions/Donations: A secondary revenue stream where super-fans pay just to support the channel content, subsidizing the business operations.
3. Critical Success Factors (The "Moat")
 * Visual Fidelity: Mechanical keyboards are sold on sound and look. If the Instagram photos aren't crisp or the Twitch mic doesn't capture the "thock" sound perfectly, sales drop.
 * Community Moderation (Discord): A toxic Discord kills a marketplace. The C500 brand depends on helpful, enthusiast-level moderation.
