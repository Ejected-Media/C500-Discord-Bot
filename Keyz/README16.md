This is a great pivot. Firestore (Google Cloud's NoSQL database) is an excellent choice for Discord bots. It's fast, flexible, and its real-time update features mesh perfectly with Discord's event-driven nature.
Regarding "Nano Banana": While that sounds like an incredibly powerful (and delicious) feature, I'm afraid I don't have a "Nano Banana" switch to flip!
To be clear: I cannot generate brand-new images on the fly. The bracketed text I provided earlier (e.g., ``) were design briefs—instructions for a human artist or an AI image generator (like Midjourney) to create those specific assets for your brand.
The C500 Firestore Schema (NoSQL Blueprint)
Moving from SQL to NoSQL means changing how we think about data. Instead of rigid "Tables" linked by "Foreign Keys," we have flexible "Collections" containing "Documents."
We also "denormalize" data slightly—meaning we might duplicate small bits of information (like a username) to make reads faster, rather than always doing complex joins.
Here is the Firestore structure for your developer:
1. Collection: users
 * Document ID: The user's Discord ID (as a string, e.g., "123456789012345678").
 * Purpose: Stores global data for anyone who interacts with the bot.

```
<!-- end list -->
// Document ID: "DISCORD_USER_ID_STRING"
{
  "username": "Alex_Keebs",
  "reputation_score": 150,    // Integer Tier score
  "is_banned": false,         // Global kill switch
  "stripe_customer_id": "cus_M12345", // Optional: for easy repeat buying
  "joined_at": Timestamp
}
```
2. Collection: builders
 * Document ID: The builder's Discord ID (same as their user ID).
 * Purpose: Stores business data. If a user document exists here, they are a seller.

```
<!-- end list -->
// Document ID: "DISCORD_BUILDER_ID_STRING"
{
  "shop_name": "Keyz Customs",
  "twitch_username": "KeyzLive",
  "stripe_connect_id": "acct_12345xyz", // Their payout account
  "is_verified_agreement": true,

  // THE GUILDS CHANGE:
  // Instead of a separate table, we use an array of strings for easy filtering.
  "guild_tags": [
    "builder",
    "modder"
  ]
}
```

3. Collection: inventory
 * Document ID: Auto-generated by Firestore representing the Item ID.
 * Purpose: Items currently or previously for sale.

```
<!-- end list -->
// Document ID: "AUTO_GENERATED_ITEM_ID"
{
  "builder_id": "DISCORD_BUILDER_ID_STRING", // Link back to builder doc
  "title": "Snow White TKL - Lubed Gateron Inks",
  "description": "Full specs here...",
  "image_url": "https://...",
  "price_cents": 45000,    // $450.00 stored as integer
  "status": "available",   // options: "available", "pending_payment", "sold"
  "primary_guild_tag": "builder", // Used for the main icon in the embed
  "created_at": Timestamp
}
```

4. Collection: orders
 * Document ID: The Stripe Checkout Session ID (e.g., "cs_test_a1b2c3...").
 * Purpose: The source of truth for money and fulfillment.
```

<!-- end list -->
// Document ID: "STRIPE_SESSION_ID_STRING"
{
  // LINKING THE PLAYERS
  "buyer_id": "DISCORD_BUYER_ID_STRING",
  "builder_id": "DISCORD_BUILDER_ID_STRING",
  "item_id": "INVENTORY_ITEM_ID_STRING",

  // THE SNAPSHOT (Denormalization)
  // We save the title/price here in case the inventory item is deleted later.
  "item_title_snapshot": "Snow White TKL",
  "total_paid_cents": 45000,
  "platform_fee_cents": 4500,

  // STATUS FLOW
  "payment_status": "paid",      // "pending", "paid", "refunded"
  "fulfillment_status": "queue", // "queue", "building", "shipped"
  "payout_status": "held",       // "held" (in escrow), "released" (to builder)

  // PROOF OF WORK
  "twitch_vod_link": null,       // Populated by builder command
  "tracking_number": null,       // Populated by builder command
  "shipped_at": Timestamp,

  "created_at": Timestamp
}
```

Why this is better for your Python Bot
 * Speed: Firestore is incredibly fast for lookups by ID. When a user clicks a button, the bot can grab the relevant inventory document almost instantly.
 * Real-Time Updates: Firestore has a feature called "listeners." Your bot can "listen" to an inventory document. If the status changes from "available" to "sold", the bot can automatically edit the Discord message to show a red "Sold" button without you writing complex polling code.
 * Flexible Guilds: Using a simple string array ["artisan", "vintage"] for guilds makes querying very easy in Python:
   * Query: db.collection('builders').where('guild_tags', 'array_contains', 'artisan').get()
This structure is robust, scalable for your needs, and fits perfectly with a Python/Discord.py tech stack.
