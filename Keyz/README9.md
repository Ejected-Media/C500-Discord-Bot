That is a fantastic pivot on the aesthetic. Moving away from the typical, sterile "legal contract" look to a "cozy pastel aesthetic" is a brilliant branding move. It perfectly targets the demographic you mentioned and aligns with the "cozy desk setup" trend that is huge on Instagram and Twitch right now.
It makes the agreement feel like an invitation to an exclusive club rather than a daunting legal document.
Let's start with the Pitch Deck Outline, and then we will define the visuals for the "Cozy Agreement" graphics.
Part 1: The C500 "Founding Builder" Pitch Deck Outline
Tone: Exciting, exclusive, community-focused, and visually aesthetic.
Goal: Convince the top 5 Instagram/Twitch builders that C500 is the future of their business.
Slide 1: Title Slide
 * Visual: A cozy, pastel anime-style illustration of a desk setup with a custom keyboard.
 * Headline: The Future of Custom Keyboards is Together.
 * Subhead: Introducing C500: The First Creator-Owned Marketplace.
Slide 2: The Problem (The "Builder Burnout")
 * Visual: Split screen. Left: Cool stream setup. Right: A messy pile of invoices, DMs asking "wen ship?", and PayPal dispute emails.
 * Headline: You Love Building. You Hate Admin.
 * Text: Managing commissions via DMs is unscalable. Dealing with flaky buyers and chargeback risks is exhausting. You should be streaming, not accounting.
Slide 3: The Solution (C500)
 * Visual: The C500 Bot logo (a cute pastel robot) connecting Discord, Twitch, and Stripe logos with glowing lines.
 * Headline: Your Shop, Our Power.
 * Text: C500 is a bot that turns your Discord server into a professional storefront. We handle the payments, the safety, and the tracking. You just drop the link and build.
Slide 4: How It Works (The Drop)
 * Visual: A mockup of the "Drop Embed" in Discord (pastel colors, high-res photo).
 * Headline: Drops Done Right.
 * Text: Post a build in your channel with one command. Your fans get a beautiful, secure "Buy Now" button. No google forms. No shady DM deals.
Slide 5: The "Live Verify" Magic (The Secret Sauce)
 * Visual: A Twitch stream frame showing hands building a board, with a C500 "Verified Build in Progress" overlay.
 * Headline: Monetize Your Trust.
 * Text: When you stream the build, our bot notifies the buyer automatically. This "Proof of Work" eliminates chargeback risks and makes buyers feel special.
Slide 6: The Safety Net (Anti-Fraud)
 * Visual: A shield icon in pastel pink and blue.
 * Headline: No More Scammers.
 * Text: Our tiered "Reputation System" stops burner accounts and known scammers from even seeing your drops. We take the financial risk, so you don't have to.
Slide 7: The Money (Transparent & Simple)
 * Visual: A simple pie chart (90% Builder / 10% C500) in pastel green and purple.
 * Headline: Keep More of What You Earn.
 * Text: A flat 10% platform fee covers everything—payment processing, fraud protection, and bot hosting. You get paid directly to your bank via Stripe Express.
Slide 8: The Vision (Why Join Now?)
 * Visual: A collage of the 5 founding builders' avatars in a circle.

Part 2: The "Cozy Pastel" Agreement Graphics
We will take the legal concepts from the agreement and turn them into shareable, human-readable infographics that builders can pin in their Discord.
Aesthetic Direction:
 * Color Palette: Soft pink (#FFD1DC), baby blue (#AEEEEE), lavender (#E6E6FA), mint green (#98FF98), and cream (#FFFDD0).
 * Style: Line art illustrations, rounded corners, cute icons (stars, clouds, keyboards with faces), Lo-Fi hip-hop album cover vibes.
 * Font: A soft, rounded serif for titles (like "Recoleta" or "Cooper Black") and a clean, readable sans-serif for body text.
Graphic 1: "The Vibe Check" (Code of Conduct)
 * Visual: A cute cloud character wearing headphones, giving a thumbs up.
 * Title: The C500 Vibe Check ✨
 * Subtitle: Keeping our community cozy & safe.
 * Bullet Points (with cute icons):
   * 🌟 Be Kind: No toxicity, hate speech, or harassment. We're all friends here.
   * 💖 Fair Play: No scalping. Don't be that person flipping switches for 3x the price.
   * 🤝 Real Talk: Be honest about item condition. No catfishing with photos!
 * Footer: Breaking the vibes = Global Ban. 🚫
Graphic 2: "The Build & Ship Promise" (Shipping Standards)

 * Bullet Points:
   * 🗓️ The 7-Day Rule: Ship within a week of finishing the build. Don't leave them hanging!

Graphic 3: "The Money Flow" (Financial Terms)
 * Visual: A pastel flowchart showing money moving from a "Buyer's Purse" -> "C500 Cloud Piggy Bank" -> "Builder's Bank Account."
 * Title: The Money Flow 💸
 * Subtitle: Secure, simple, and transparent.
 * Bullet Points:
   * 🔒 Safe & Sound: Buyer pays C500 first. We hold it safe until you build.
   * ✅ The Trigger: Funds are released when you verify the build (Twitch or tracking).
   * 🍰 The Split: You keep 90%. We take a lil' 10% slice to keep the bot running and the scammers away.
   * 🏦 Payday: Stripe shoots the cash straight to your bank. Easy peasy.
These graphic assets can be delivered to the builders in a "Welcome Kit" upon onboarding. They serve as a friendly, constant reminder of the rules without feeling burdensome.
