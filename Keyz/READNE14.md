Let's do the fun, aesthetic part first. Define the visual identity of the Guilds and how they will be represented.
In the cozy C500 aesthetic, the Guild Badges should feel less like a "military rank" and more like a collectible charm or enamel pin. They are designed to look cute as small emojis next to a name, but also detailed enough to be a large emblem on a shop header.
Here are the 4 Founding Guilds and their visual design concepts.
The Cozy Guild Visual Style Guide
 * Shape: Rounded emblems, circular or soft shield shapes.
 * Line Work: Soft, colored outlines (not harsh black). Think a deep lavender outline instead of black.
 * Texture: Smooth, matte finish, like a ceramic pin or a polished keycap.
 * Palette: Strictly the "Cloud 500" pastel palette.
1. The Artisan Guild (The Sculptors)
 * Concept: For the builders who hand-sculpt or cast unique resin keycaps. They are the artists of the collective.
 * Icon Metaphor: Creation, hand-made, magic.
 * Badge Design:
   * Main Element: A cute, pastel Potion Bottle or Paint Palette with a glowing keycap floating above it.
   * Colors: Soft lavender, baby pink, and cream.
   * Emoji Vibe: A whimsical artist's tool.
   * Example Discord Emoji Name: :c500_artisan:
2. The Builder Guild (The Engineers)
 * Concept: For the technical experts who specialize in soldering, tuning stabilizers, and assembling flawless, high-performance boards.
 * Icon Metaphor: Precision, tools, structure.
 * Badge Design:
   * Main Element: A crossed Wrench and Soldering Iron, but drawn in a cute, chibi style. The soldering iron has a tiny puff of pastel "steam" (smoke).
   * Colors: Mint green, baby blue, and soft silver.
   * Emoji Vibe: Reliable and skilled, but cute.
   * Example Discord Emoji Name: :c500_builder:
3. The Modder Guild (The Tuners)
 * Concept: For specialists who offer services like switch lubing, film installation, and foam modding. They refine existing parts.
 * Icon Metaphor: Enhancement, smoothness, liquids.
 * Badge Design:
   * Main Element: A tiny, cute Lube Brush dipping into a pot of "krytox" (represented as a glowing pastel liquid droplet).
   * Colors: Pastel yellow/cream, soft orange, and light blue.
   * Emoji Vibe: Satisfying and smooth.
   * Example Discord Emoji Name: :c500_modder:
4. The Vintage Guild (The Restorers)
 * Concept: For builders who focus on restoring retro boards (IBM Model M, Apple Extended Keyboard). They value history.
 * Icon Metaphor: Time, retro tech, classic.
 * Badge Design:
   * Main Element: A stylized Retro Floppy Disk or an old CRT Monitor with a pixelated heart on the screen.
   * Colors: Muted pastel browns (like coffee and cream), soft beige, and pale orange.
   * Emoji Vibe: Nostalgic and cozy.
   * Example Discord Emoji Name: :c500_vintage:

These icons do a lot of heavy lifting. They instantly tell the buyer the builder's specialty, they reinforce the brand's "cozy collective" vibe, and they act as a status symbol for the builders themselves.
