This "Welcome Kit" is the first physical and digital touchpoint that signals to your builders: "You aren't just a vendor; you are family."
Below is the C500 Founding Builder Welcome Kit, designed with the "Cozy Pastel" aesthetic.
1. The Digital Assets (The "Cozy" Palette)
To ensure every builder's shop feels like part of the same universe, provide them with this specific style guide. These colors should be used for their Discord Embeds, Twitch Overlays, and "Available Now" posts.
The "Cloud 500" Color Palette:
 * Sakura Milk: #FFD1DC (Primary Highlight / "Buy" Buttons)
 * Dreamy Sky: #AEEEEE (Secondary Accents / Links)
 * Lavender Mist: #E6E6FA (Backgrounds / Headers)
 * Mint Matcha: #98FF98 (Success Messages / "In Stock" Status)
 * Vanilla Cream: #FFFDD0 (Text Color / Warm White)
The Font Stack:
 * Headlines: Recoleta or Cooper Black (Soft, chubby serifs that feel friendly)
 * Body Text: Quicksand or Nunito (Rounded sans-serifs that are easy to read)
2. The Graphic Assets (Infographics)
These are the files you would attach to the Welcome Email. They are designed to be pinned in Discord channels.
Asset A: The "Vibe Check" (Code of Conduct)
>  * Visual: A soft lavender background. A cute cloud character ("Cloudy") wearing a headset.
>  * Text:
>    * Be Kind: Toxicity = Instant Ban. We keep it cozy here.
>    * Be Real: No scalping. No catfishing. Real builds for real fans.
>    * Be You: We love your style. Customize your shop, but keep the vibes safe.
> 
Asset B: The "Money Flow" (Transparency)
>  * Visual: A pastel green flow chart connecting a generic "User" to a "Piggy Bank" to a "Bank Building."
>  * Text:
>    * Step 1: Buyer pays C500 (We keep it safe). 🔒
>    * Step 2: You build & stream. 📹
>    * Step 3: You ship & track. 📦
>    * Step 4: Cha-ching! 90% goes straight to your bank. 💸
> 
Asset C: The "Ship It" Guide (SLA)
>  * Visual: A pastel pink box with wings flying through clouds.
>  * Text:
>    * 7 Days: Tracking must be live within a week of the build.
>    * Thock Protection: Double-box it. If it rattles, it breaks.
>    * Insurance: Always insure for full value.
> 
3. The "Founding Builder" Invitation (The Email/DM)
This is the message you send to the first 5 builders to get them on board. It needs to feel personal, exclusive, and low-pressure.
Subject: ☁️ You’re invited: Be a Founding Builder for C500
Body:
> "Hey [Builder Name]!
> I've been lurking in your streams for a while (loved that [Keyboard Name] build you did last week!).
> I'm building something new called C500—it’s a dedicated marketplace for keyboard builders that handles all the boring stuff (payments, chargeback protection, inventory) so you can just focus on building and streaming.
> The Pitch:
>  * No more DMs: You get a custom Bot for your Discord that handles sales instantly.
>  * No more Scams: We verify buyers so you never get hit with 'Friendly Fraud.'
>  * Monetize your Stream: Use your Twitch builds to 'unlock' payments automatically.
> I’m looking for 5 Founding Builders to help launch this. No fees to join, and you keep 90% of everything you sell.
> If you're down to try it, I’ve attached a Welcome Kit with the vibe we’re going for.
> Let me know if you want the invite code for the Founders Discord!
> Stay cozy,
> [Your Name]"
> 
4. Physical "Swag" (Optional for later)
If you want to send a physical welcome box to these 5 founders later, keep it on-brand:
 * Custom Deskmat: A high-quality "Cloud 500" deskmat (Pastel clouds).
 * Switch Puller: A titanium switch puller anodized in pink or blue.
 * Sticker Pack: Die-cut holographic stickers of the C500 Bot to put on their PC case (free advertising for you when they stream!).
Next step you can do for me:
We have the Kit, the Pitch, and the Model. Would you like to switch gears to the Technical Roadmap (How to actually code the Discord Bot + Stripe integration)?
