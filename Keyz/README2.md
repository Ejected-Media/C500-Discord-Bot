Thank you for that clarification. That is a significant pivot from the standard "Group Buy" model and actually places C500 in a much more scalable, yet operationally complex position.
You are describing a Distributed Fulfillment Marketplace (similar to Etsy or a curated dropshipping model), but with a high-trust verification layer added via Twitch.
Here is the revised business model breakdown for C500 based on this "Builder-as-Fulfiller" dynamic:
The C500 "Distributed Fulfillment" Model
In this model, C500 does not hold inventory. Instead, C500 is the Platform and Escrow Agent. You are monetizing the trust and transaction, while the "Builders" (who you recruit from Instagram/Twitch) handle the inventory and shipping.
1. The Supply Side: The "Streamer-Builders"
 * Recruitment (Instagram): You use Instagram not just to sell to customers, but to scout "Certified Builders." You look for builders with high-aesthetic feeds.
 * Verification (Twitch): This is your Quality Assurance (QA). A builder isn't just someone with a soldering iron; they are a content creator.
   * The Requirement: To sell on C500, the builder must stream the assembly of the unit. This proves the board exists and was built to spec (lubed switches, stabilizer tuning, etc.).
2. The Transaction Core: Discord
The user explicitly stated Discord is the store interface. This is the most unique part of your model.
 * The "Walled Garden" Store: Instead of a public website, the inventory is listed in Discord channels (e.g., #available-builds).
 * The Sales Mechanic:
   * Listing: A Builder posts a "Build Ticket" in Discord (Specs + Price + Twitch VOD link).
   * Claiming: A Buyer opens a ticket to claim the board.
   * Payment/Escrow: The Buyer pays C500 (not the builder directly).
   * Fulfillment Trigger: C500 notifies the Builder to ship the board to the Buyer.
   * Payout: Once the Buyer confirms receipt (or tracking confirms delivery), C500 releases the funds to the Builder, minus the C500 commission.
3. The Value Proposition (Why do they need C500?)
 * For the Buyer: Safety. Buying a custom mechanical keyboard from a random Instagram user is risky. C500 provides money-back protection and verifies the builder via Twitch history.
 * For the Builder: Audience & Admin. Builders love building/streaming but hate handling payments, customer support, and dispute resolution. C500 handles the "business" side so they can just stream and build.
Revised Ecosystem Flow

| Platform | Function | The Action |
|---|---|---|
| Instagram | Talent Scout & Catalog | C500 reposts Builders' work. "Want this board? It's available on our Discord." |
| Twitch | Proof of Product | The Builder streams the assembly. "Watch me build the order for User123." |
| Discord | Point of Sale (POS) | The transaction happens here. Invoicing, shipping tracking, and support. |

Potential Operational Risk
Since this is "drop shipping" where the builder holds the stock, the biggest risk is shipping consistency.
 * Scenario: A builder streams the build on Twitch (looks great), takes the order via Discord, but then delays shipping for 3 weeks or packs it poorly.
 * Solution: C500 needs a strict "Shipping Standard" agreement that builders must sign to remain on the platform.
Next step you can do for me:
Since Discord is the actual "Store Interface," would you like to map out the Bot/Automation workflow for how a sale is actually processed? (e.g., How does the money move from the user to you, and then to the builder?)
