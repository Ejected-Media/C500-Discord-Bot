That process map is a great start! It gives a clear, linear view of a single transaction.
To help new people—both Builders and Buyers—truly grasp the entire C500 ecosystem, there are three other key concepts that are best explained visually. These graphics would be perfect for an "About Us" page or a "How it Works" channel in Discord.
Here are three more helpful graphics to draw, focusing on Architecture, Finance, and Trust.
1. The "Ecosystem Overview" (The Architecture)
This graphic explains the most confusing part of C500: How does one bot connect many different private servers into a single marketplace?
What it clarifies: It shows that C500 isn't just one Discord server. It's a "network" or a "federation." It visualizes the Bot as the central brain that connects independent Builder Servers to the core services like Stripe and Twitch.
How to explain it to a new person:
"Think of C500 like a power strip. Each Builder has their own private server (their own 'lamp'), but they all plug into the central C500 Bot to get power, payment processing, and security. This means you can shop from many different trusted builders without ever leaving the C500 network."
2. The "Financial Flow & Escrow" (The Money)
This is the most important graphic for your Builders. It details exactly how the money is split, where it is held, and what triggers the payout.
What it clarifies: It visualizes the 90/10 split, the concept of "Escrow" (holding funds for safety), and the specific actions (streaming or shipping) that unlock the money. This builds massive trust with builders who are wary of payment platforms.
How to explain it to a new person:
"Your money is safe with us. When you buy, your payment goes into a secure 'Escrow Vault.' The Builder can see the funds are there, but they can't touch them until they prove they've done the work—either by streaming the build on Twitch or providing a tracking number. Once verified, the vault opens, and they get paid instantly."
3. The "Reputation & Trust Cycle" (The Buyer Journey)
This graphic is for the Buyers. It explains why they should care about their account history and how they can unlock perks like buying higher-value items.
What it clarifies: It shows the path from a "New User" (high risk, low limits) to a "Trusted VIP" (low risk, high limits). It visualizes how successful purchases and verification actions (like linking Twitch) feed into their "Reputation Score," which in turn unlocks more access.
How to explain it to a new person:
"Trust is a currency on C500. You start as a 'Guest,' but with every successful purchase and verification, your Reputation grows. Leveling up your trust tier unlocks the ability to buy exclusive, high-value 'Grail' keyboards and join early-access drops. Prove you're a great buyer, and you get the best access."
Together with your existing Process Map, these three graphics create a complete visual "handbook" for the C500 Marketplace, covering How it Works, How Money Moves, and How Trust is Earned.
