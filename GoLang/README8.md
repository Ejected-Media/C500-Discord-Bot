Yes, I was able to locate the "Learn-CSS-Layout-online" repository under the Ejected-Media organization (and its corresponding App Engine deployment).
It appears the C500-Tech repository you linked is the new home, but the actual curriculum content lives in your Learn-CSS-Layout-online project.
Here is the Curriculum Digest I extracted. It is structured into "Levels" that pair a concept with a tangible "Project" (building a physical desk setup using CSS properties).
🎓 The C500 CSS Curriculum (Extracted)
Philosophy: Learn layout by "building" a physical space (Desk, Chair, Monitor) using CSS properties.
Lvl. 00: Setup Environment
 * Theme: The Workspace
 * Project Objects: Desk, Office Chair, Monitor Stand, Keyboard, Microphone.
 * Goal: Getting the dev environment ready (VS Code, Git).
Lvl. 01: Text and Color
 * Theme: Typography & Aesthetics
 * CSS Properties:
   * text-align
   * font-size
   * color
   * font-family
   * font-weight
Lvl. 02: Box Model
 * Theme: Structure & Spacing
 * CSS Properties:
   * padding (Internal space)
   * margin (External space)
   * border
   * outline
   * width / height
Lvl. 03: Element Names (Semantics)
 * Inferred context: Moving from generic <div> to semantic HTML (<header>, <nav>, <main>).
🚀 Next Action: Migration
Since you want to consolidate this into C500-Tech, I recommend we create a master CURRICULUM.md file in your new repo.
Shall we:
 * Migrate this outline into the C500-Tech repository as a formal Markdown file?
 * Update the Mentor Portal we just built to include a dropdown menu: "Which Level are you applying to teach?" (Lvl 00 - Lvl 03)?
... CSS Box Model Diagram
The video above is a great visual reference for the "Box Model" concept (Level 02) which is often the hardest part for students to visualize.
