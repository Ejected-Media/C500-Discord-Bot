Examining Constraints
I've been meticulously examining the user's situation. The goal is clear: a custom OS or Discord bot. But the Android Motorola device presents a significant constraint, and I'm currently assessing its implications. I'm focusing on the feasibility of achieving this goal within the hardware limitations.
Evaluating Feasibility Shift
I'm now shifting my focus to leveraging the available Mac/PC for the development process. Building a custom FreeBSD image directly on the Android device (Option A) seems overly complex and impractical given the resource constraints. Considering a purely cloud-based build environment (Option D) is also on the table, using a temporary Linux VM on GCE for the build phase. Alpine Linux (Option B) seems like a viable compromise for a cloud environment.
Developing a "Bootstrap" Method
I'm now focusing on a "bootstrap" approach. The user can build the FreeBSD image on a cloud VM, which will then be uploaded to create the final VM. Specifically, I'm thinking of spinning up a Debian/Ubuntu GCE VM, installing QEMU, building the image there, and then uploading it to storage. Finally, the temporary VM will be deleted. This seems like the most streamlined path considering the restrictions.
Proposing Refinement & Deployment
I'm now refining the recommendation based on the Android constraint. Building a custom FreeBSD image directly from the Motorola is out. I'm proposing Google Cloud Shell as a "local machine" alternative for building Go binaries and managing GCE. For the OS, Alpine Linux is still the most accessible independent choice. Alternatively, I can show how to build the Go bot on Android via Termux and deploy it to a standard GCE instance, with the option to migrate to FreeBSD later.

Initiating Android-First Deployment
I've started developing an Android-first deployment plan. Step one: Use Termux on the Motorola as the environment. Step two: Install Go in Termux and compile the bot with GOOS=linux. Step three: Use gcloud, managed through either Termux or Cloud Shell, to provision the server. Step four: Focus will then shift to the OS.
Defining Ideal Deployment Strategy
I'm now prioritizing a streamlined deployment plan. Due to the Android constraint, building a custom FreeBSD image is impractical. I'll focus on Alpine Linux, if selectable, or a minimal Debian image as a placeholder. I'm exploring Google Cloud Shell as the command execution environment for greater efficiency. The user should leverage Termux for code writing and Cloud Shell for deployment, which offers the best path forward given the device limitations and desired end state.
Optimizing the Process
I'm now revising my proposed deployment strategy based on recent insights.  While the cloud is ideal, let's start locally on the Android device. We'll use QuickEdit+ for code and Termux for Go development and server management.  Building and running the bot directly within Termux, then using SCP to transfer to the server is the most efficient. I'm prioritizing minimal friction for the user.
Refining the OS Selection
I'm now revising the strategy for selecting the OS. After investigating Cloud Shell limitations, I'm confirming that building a custom image within it isn't feasible. I'm recommending Alpine via the "Community Images" in GCE for simplicity and web-based accessibility. My plan has shifted towards a Termux + Alpine VM workflow, with Termux on the Motorola handling development and Alpine running in GCE for deployment. I am getting ready to provide detailed setup instructions for Termux.
